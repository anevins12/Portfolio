					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>
						Hi, I'm just going to be telling you a little bit about me, so I don't turn out to be a robot.
					</p>

				<div class="col large">
					<h4>Where I am now</h4>
					<p>
						I'm in Bristol and working at Nomensa as a Front-End Developer.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've just finished my University course in Web Design and have achieved a <strong>1st class degree</strong> :) and
						Graduation is soon so I can't wait for that. 
					</p>
					<p>
					<p>
						Last year I did a placement year and had a really insightful experience
						learning about Web Development and Front-End Development in 2 digital agencies.

					<h5>What I like to do</h5>
					<div class="col">
						<h6>Take pictures of stuff</h6>
						<p>
							Yeah, I'm not a photographer but just another fan of Instagram.
						</p>
						<p>
							I did however like taking photos of stuff before Instagram came out ;)
						</p>

					<div class="col swim">
						<h6>Swim</h6>
						<p>
							After training for a swimming test for a canoe club,
							I've discovered how great swimming is! No, really, I'm serious, but not really.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm not competitive, but I find swimming really helps relieve stress.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="col">
						<h6>Help WordPress</h6>
						<p>
							9 months ago I needed some help on WordPress.org's forums.
							I didn't get an answer, but I found I could answer other people. Great!
							I felt useful.
						</p>
						<p>
							Ever since then, I've been helping people out with basic WordPress stuff, but mainly it's CSS and HTML support.
						</p>
						<p>
							I've even been given an Administrator account :)

					<div class="col">
						<h6>Other</h6>
						<p>
							I do have other hobbies, but I think I'll be going OTT with this page if I say them all.
